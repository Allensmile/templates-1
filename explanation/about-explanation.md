# The explanation article

## When do I need an explanation article?

Explanations (also called discussions), explain background information and provide context-specific knowledge on a particular topic.

The goals of an explanation article are understanding-oriented, not procedural or learning.

Explanation articles work well when they deliver the following types of information:

* They give context to a subject or topic that your audience may not have
* They explain the "why" about a topic that may not be evident in reference or how-to articles
* They suggest alternative approaches or different ways of thinking about a customer challenge or technical topic
* They allow your audience to make connections between related concepts, so they can form a better understanding of the subject.

## Content of your explanation article

### About the "Overview" section

Summarise what the reader will get from reading the explanation article.

Creating a good overview comes down to thinking about who is going to be using it:

* Are you writing only for end-users? For developers?
* Are you writing only for people who have a certain problem to solve?
* Is it intended for a particular industry.

### About the "Glossary" section

If you plan on using a whole lot of terms that might not be familiar to your readers, list them all in this section.

Declaring them here lets you use any abbreviated forms of the terminology you're using in the body of the explanation.

### Structuring explanation articles

Think about structuring explanation topics like you would a presentation to a group of folks who don't know anything about your chosen subject.
Your explanation should introduce ideas gradually, so your audience can grow their understanding of the concepts it covers.

It can be easy to blend explanations with other types of content, like how-to or reference articles.
Here are a few tips to avoid mixing documentation types:

* Avoid instructions, procedures, or any content that doesn't focus solely on building upon the conceptual understanding of the explanation topic.
* If you find yourself writing steps or describing how to do something in detail in your explanation article, chances are you need to shift your focus away from the "doing" and remind yourself of the main goals.

Here are some clues that your explanation article is not staying on-topic.

| Clue | Solution |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| You start to write steps to achieve something that you're describing in your topic. | Look for opportunities to link to other topics that complement your explanation content. Link to these articles in-line or at the end of the document in the "Where to next" section. |
| You think that inserting a tutorial video about the explanation item directly into the article is necessary. | Link to the video in the "Where to next" section, so your audience doesn't get distracted by the video. |
| You begin including YAML and JSON structures of end-points that you can call in your conceptual explanation of an API. | You are mixing too much reference content into your explanation article. Bring the focus back to understanding the structures, not documenting all the things you can do with them. If your explanation article still needs to link back to the API, you can add the link with a brief explanation to the Related Articles section.  |
